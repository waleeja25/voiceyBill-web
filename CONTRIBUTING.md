# Contributing to voiceyBill-web

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

## Ground rules

- Be respectful and constructive in all discussions.
- Focus pull requests on one clear change.
- Open an issue before starting major features.
- Do not include secrets or production credentials in any commit.
- Use the issue templates for every new issue. Blank issues are disabled.
- Use the PR template for every pull request. PRs without the template completed are not considered ready for review.
- Include screenshots, screen recordings, or GIFs for UI, interaction, or chart changes.

## Development setup

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Use Node.js 20 or later.
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Branch and commit conventions

- Branch names should be descriptive, for example:
  - `feat/add-dashboard-filter`
  - `fix/navbar-mobile-overflow`
- Use clear commits that explain why the change is needed.

## Pull request requirements

- PR titles are validated in CI and should follow Conventional Commits style:
  - `feat(ui): Add transaction chart tooltip`
  - `fix(table): Prevent empty row rendering`
- Keep PRs small and easy to review.
- Link related issues, for example `Closes #123`.
- Include screenshots or recordings for visual changes.
- Use the PR template at [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md). It loads automatically when you open a PR. Fill in every section before requesting review.

## Quality checks

Before opening a PR, run:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
npm test --if-present
```

## Issues and templates

Issues of all kinds are welcome. You do not need permission to open one. Bug reports, feature ideas, questions, suggestions, discussions, and anything else you want to raise are all fair game.

When your issue matches one of the templates below, use it. GitHub shows the template picker automatically when you click New Issue:

- **Bug report** - a reproducible defect with steps, expected result, and actual result
- **Feature request** - a new feature or improvement with a clear problem statement
- **Question** - usage, setup, or clarification help

Templates are at [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/). If your issue does not fit any template, open a blank issue and describe it clearly. Do not leave required template fields empty.

Keep one issue focused on one topic so it can be triaged quickly. Include a screenshot or recording for anything visual or hard to explain in text.

## Security policy

- Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.
- Use GitHub Security Advisories for responsible disclosure.

## Helpful setup reminders

- The web app runs directly with Vite on your machine.
- Set `VITE_API_URL` to the running backend when testing features end-to-end.
